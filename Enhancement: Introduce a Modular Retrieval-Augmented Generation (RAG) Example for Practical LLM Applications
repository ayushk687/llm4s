## Overview

This PR introduces a modular Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) example to demonstrate how to ground Large Language Model (LLM) responses using external knowledge sources.

The goal of this enhancement is to provide a practical, production-aligned architecture that helps reduce hallucinations and improves response reliability.

---

## Motivation

While the repository currently provides foundational LLM usage examples, it does not include a real-world architecture demonstrating:

- Context grounding
- Hallucination mitigation
- Vector similarity search
- Modular LLM pipeline design

RAG is widely adopted in modern LLM applications, and including a structured example significantly improves the repository’s educational and practical value.
